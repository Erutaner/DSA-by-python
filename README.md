# Progamiz-DSA-in-python
I'm an undergraduate in China. Recently I've been learning DSA on a website called Programiz and found some mistakes in the python code displayed on this website. 
Although most of them are trivial, I still believe these kind of mistakes can mislead or at least bother some of the DSA beginners like me. So I created this repo to
record my own DSA code.
